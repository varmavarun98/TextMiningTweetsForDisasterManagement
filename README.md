# TextMiningTweetsForDisasterManagement

Twitter is a free social networking service that allows people to broadcast short posts called tweets. Tweets can serve as a data source to detect real time disaster events that can be utilized to dig significant information for crisis reaction and relief operation.  It is easy for a human to identify whether a tweet is related to disaster or not as some words can be used both in disaster as well as non disaster tweets but very difficult for a machine to identify.  
 
Created a machine learning model in python on a Kaggle dataset to build machine learning models in Python for classifying tweets to disastrous or non-disastrous. Used the GloVe technique for word embeddings. Modeled the data using Logistic Regression, KNN, XG Boost, Classification Decision Tree and Voting Classification Method.
